	<h2> Introduction </h2>
Kyntic is an open source project. As Kyntic is developed as an open-source project, the original source code contains methods to, but does not collect or store, any user data inherently. However, you may choose to download and use the copy of Kyntic available on our website or on our releases page. In that case, we will be utilizing Supabase (privacy policy) to sync and store some vital data items that we collect. This privacy policy explains what data we collect from you in order to operate this service, and how you could control, update, or request the deletion of this data. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

Throughout this policy, "our Service" is defined as the packaged version of the Kyntic application downloaded from our website, the Apple App Store, or on our releases page. "Our Product" is defined as the Kyntic application and its source code available on the GitHub repository. This privacy policy does not govern the usage of our Product, which is an open source project that contains methods to, but does not collect or store, any user data inherently.

The usage of both our Product and our Service is also governed by GNU GPL v3.0 as our Licensing Terms.

<h2> Information Collection and Use </h2>
For a better experience while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to your name and your email. Additionally, parts of your account will also be collected solely for enabling the syncing and backing up of your account should the option be enabled. The information needed for the sole purpose of account data backup includes, but is not limited to, your mbient lab sensor data, your self logged data, and your email. These information is encrypted using industry-standard encryption systems before being retained. The information that we request will be retained by us and used as described in this privacy policy.

The app uses Supabase third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

<h2> Data Security </h2>

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.
